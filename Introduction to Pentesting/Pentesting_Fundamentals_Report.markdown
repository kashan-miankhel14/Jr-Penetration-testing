## Problems Solved and Methods Used
1. **Defining Penetration Testing and Hacker Types**:
   - **Problem**: Understand what penetration testing is and differentiate between hacker types.
   - **Solution**:
     - Learned that penetration testing involves finding and exploiting vulnerabilities with explicit permission, as outlined in the ROE.
     - Answered questions about hacker types (e.g., White Hat for ethical hackers, Black Hat for malicious hackers).
     - Reviewed the room’s content on the importance of permission and scope in pentesting.
   - **Commands/Techniques**:
     - No commands required; theoretical answers submitted via TryHackMe’s interface.
     - Browser: Submitted answers like “What type of hacker performs unauthorized attacks?” (Answer: Black Hat).

2. **Understanding Pentesting Methodologies**:
   - **Problem**: Identify industry-standard pentesting frameworks and their stages.
   - **Solution**:
     - Studied frameworks like OSSTMM, OWASP, and NIST, focusing on stages like Information Gathering, Exploitation, and Post-Exploitation.
     - Answered questions about specific frameworks and stages (e.g., Information Gathering as the initial stage).
     - Reviewed the room’s content on practical methodologies, such as using tools like Metasploit for exploitation.
   - **Commands/Techniques**:
     - No commands required; theoretical answers submitted via TryHackMe’s interface.
     - Browser: Submitted answers like “What stage involves using publicly available information?” (Answer: Information Gathering).
     - Optional exploration: Used `whois <MACHINE_IP>` to simulate basic information gathering.

3. **Exploring the Rules of Engagement (ROE)**:
   - **Problem**: Understand the components of the ROE in a pentesting engagement.
   - **Solution**:
     - Learned that the ROE defines permission, scope, and rules for a pentesting engagement.
     - Answered questions about the ROE’s components (e.g., permission for testing).
     - Reviewed the room’s content on how ROE ensures ethical and legal testing.
   - **Commands/Techniques**:
     - No commands required; theoretical answers submitted via TryHackMe’s interface.
     - Browser: Submitted answers like “What document defines how a pentesting engagement is carried out?” (Answer: Rules of Engagement).

## Tools Used
- **Browser (Firefox/Chrome)**: For accessing TryHackMe’s interface and submitting answers.
- **whois (optional)**: For simulating basic information gathering.
- **TryHackMe Platform**: For theoretical content and question submission.
