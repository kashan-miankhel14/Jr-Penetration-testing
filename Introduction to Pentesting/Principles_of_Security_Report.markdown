# TryHackMe Jr Penetration Tester: Principles of Security Report

## Overview
This room covers the core principles of information security, including the CIA triad, STRIDE model, and security models like Biba, with theoretical questions to reinforce understanding.[](https://medium.com/%40ERBATMAN/tryhackme-jr-penetration-tester-introduction-to-pentesting-ca886550bd37)

## Problems Solved and Methods Used
1. **Understanding the CIA Triad**:
   - **Problem**: Define the elements of the CIA triad and their application.
   - **Solution**:
     - Learned that the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) ensures data security by controlling access, ensuring accuracy, and maintaining accessibility.
     - Answered questions about each element’s role (e.g., Integrity for preventing unauthorized data changes).
     - Reviewed the room’s content on practical applications, such as encryption for Confidentiality.
   - **Commands/Techniques**:
     - No commands required; theoretical answers submitted via TryHackMe’s interface.
     - Browser: Submitted answers like “What element ensures data cannot be altered by unauthorized people?” (Answer: Integrity).

2. **Exploring the STRIDE Model**:
   - **Problem**: Identify threats in the STRIDE model and their mitigation.
   - **Solution**:
     - Studied the STRIDE model (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege).
     - Answered questions about specific threats (e.g., Tampering for data integrity issues).
     - Reviewed the room’s content on mitigating threats, such as using authentication to prevent Spoofing.
   - **Commands/Techniques**:
     - No commands required; theoretical answers submitted via TryHackMe’s interface.
     - Browser: Submitted answers like “What STRIDE principle involves altering data?” (Answer: Tampering).

3. **Applying Security Models and Acronyms**:
   - **Problem**: Understand security models like Biba and acronyms like PIM.
   - **Solution**:
     - Learned about the Biba model, which focuses on data integrity for software development.
     - Answered questions about security models and acronyms like PIM (Privileged Identity Management).
     - Reviewed the room’s content on how models and methodologies enhance security.
   - **Commands/Techniques**:
     - No commands required; theoretical answers submitted via TryHackMe’s interface.
     - Browser: Submitted answers like “What model is used by software developers for integrity?” (Answer: Biba Model).
