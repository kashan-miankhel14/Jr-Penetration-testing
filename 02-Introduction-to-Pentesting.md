# Introduction to Pentesting

This section covers the fundamentals of penetration testing, including the ethics, methodologies, and different types of penetration tests.

## Penetration Testing Fundamentals

### What is Penetration Testing?

A penetration test, or pentest, is an authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system, performed to evaluate the security of the system. The test is performed to identify both weaknesses (also referred to as vulnerabilities), including the potential for unauthorized parties to gain access to the system's features and data, as well as strengths, enabling a full risk assessment to be completed.

### Penetration Testing Ethics

- **White Hat Hacker:** An ethical hacker who has permission to perform security testing.
- **Black Hat Hacker:** A malicious hacker who exploits vulnerabilities for personal gain.
- **Grey Hat Hacker:** A hacker who may not have malicious intent, but performs security testing without permission.

**Rules of Engagement:** A document that defines the scope, objectives, and rules for a penetration testing engagement.

### Penetration Testing Methodologies

- **OSSTMM (Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual):** A peer-reviewed methodology for performing security tests. It is focused on the technical details of testing and is very comprehensive.
- **OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project):** A framework that focuses on the testing of web applications. The OWASP Top 10 is a list of the most critical web application security risks.
- **NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology):** Provides a framework for improving critical infrastructure cybersecurity.
- **PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard):** A standard that provides a baseline for what is required for a penetration test.

### Black box, White box, Grey box Penetration Testing

- **Black Box:** The tester has no prior knowledge of the system being tested.
- **White Box:** The tester has full knowledge of the system being tested, including access to the source code.
- **Grey Box:** The tester has some knowledge of the system being tested.

## Principles of Security

### The CIA Triad

- **Confidentiality:** Ensures that data is only accessed by authorized people.
- **Integrity:** Ensures that data cannot be altered by unauthorized people.
- **Availability:** Ensures that data is available when needed.

### Principles of Privileges

- **Privileged Identity Management (PIM):** A system that manages the roles and access rights of privileged users.
- **Privileged Access Management (PAM):** A system that manages and monitors the activities of privileged users.

### Security Models

- **The Bell-LaPadula Model:** A model that focuses on confidentiality. It uses the rules "can't read up, can read down".
- **The Biba Model:** A model that focuses on integrity. It uses the rules "can read up, can't read down".

### Threat Modelling & Incident Response

- **STRIDE:** A model for identifying and categorizing threats. It stands for Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege.
- **Incident Response (IR):** The process of responding to and managing a security incident. The stages of incident response are Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Lessons Learned.
