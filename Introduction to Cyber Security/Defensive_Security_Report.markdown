# TryHackMe Jr Penetration Tester: Defensive Security Report

## Overview
This room introduces defensive security, focusing on protecting systems from threats through monitoring, detection, and response. It covers the CIA triad and incident response, with theoretical questions to reinforce concepts.[](https://iritt.medium.com/offensive-security-intro-jr-penetration-tester-introduction-to-cyber-security-tryhackme-7590404f2e46)

## Problems Solved and Methods Used
1. **Understanding the CIA Triad**:
   - **Problem**: Define the elements of the CIA triad and their importance in defensive security.
   - **Solution**:
     - Learned that the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) ensures data security by protecting access, accuracy, and accessibility.
     - Answered questions about each element’s role (e.g., ensuring data cannot be altered by unauthorized users).
     - Submitted answers via TryHackMe’s interface.
   - **Commands/Techniques**:
     - No commands required; theoretical answers submitted via TryHackMe’s interface.
     - Read and understood content: Reviewed definitions (e.g., Integrity prevents unauthorized data modification).
     - Browser: Used TryHackMe’s interface to submit answers like “What element ensures data is only accessed by authorized people?” (Answer: Confidentiality).

2. **Exploring Incident Response Stages**:
   - **Problem**: Identify the stages of incident response and their application.
   - **Solution**:
     - Studied the incident response stages: Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Lessons Learned.
     - Answered questions about specific stages (e.g., returning an organization to normal operations after a breach).
     - Used the room’s content to understand practical applications, such as restoring systems during the Recovery stage.
   - **Commands/Techniques**:
     - No commands required; theoretical answers submitted via TryHackMe’s interface.
     - Browser: Submitted answers like “What incident response stage involves returning to business as usual?” (Answer: Recovery).

3. **Applying Defensive Security Concepts**:-
   - **Problem**: Understand tools or methodologies like Privileged Access Management (PAM).
   - **Solution**:
     - Learned about PAM and its role in managing privileged accounts to enhance security.
     - Answered questions about acronyms like PAM and PIM (Privileged Identity Management).
     - Reviewed the room’s content to understand how defensive measures protect against unauthorized access.
   - **Commands/Techniques**:
     - No commands required; theoretical answers submitted via TryHackMe’s interface.
     - Browser: Submitted answers like “What does the acronym PAM stand for?” (Answer: Privileged Access Management).
