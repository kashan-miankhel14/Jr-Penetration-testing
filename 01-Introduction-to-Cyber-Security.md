# Introduction to Cyber Security

This section provides a foundational understanding of cyber security, covering the core concepts of offensive and defensive security, and the various career paths available in the field.

## Key Concepts

### Offensive Security (Red Team)

Offensive security involves proactively finding vulnerabilities in systems by simulating the actions of an attacker. The goal is to identify weaknesses before malicious actors can exploit them.

- **Penetration Testing:** A simulated cyber attack against a computer system to check for exploitable vulnerabilities.
- **Ethical Hacking:** The practice of using hacking skills for defensive purposes.
- **Red Teaming:** A full-scope, multi-layered attack simulation that tests an organization's security posture, including its people, processes, and technology.

### Defensive Security (Blue Team)

Defensive security focuses on protecting an organization's assets from threats. This involves implementing security controls, monitoring systems for malicious activity, and responding to incidents.

- **Security Operations Center (SOC):** A centralized unit that deals with security issues on an organizational and technical level.
- **Incident Response:** The process of responding to and managing a security breach or cyberattack.
- **Threat Intelligence:** The practice of collecting and analyzing information about current and potential attacks.

### Purple Teaming

Purple teaming is a collaborative approach where red and blue teams work together to improve an organization's security posture. The red team shares its attack techniques with the blue team, and the blue team provides feedback on its detection and response capabilities. This continuous feedback loop helps to improve the overall security of the organization.

## Careers in Cyber Security

There are many different career paths available in cyber security, including:

- **Penetration Tester (Ethical Hacker):** Responsible for identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in systems.
- **Security Analyst:** Responsible for monitoring and analyzing security events to detect and respond to threats.
- **Security Engineer:** Responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining security systems.
- **Security Consultant:** Provides expert advice to organizations on how to improve their security posture.
- **Digital Forensics Investigator:** Responsible for collecting and analyzing digital evidence to investigate cybercrimes.
